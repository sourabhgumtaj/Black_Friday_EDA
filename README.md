1. Data Exploration
Explored the dataset using different functions like head, tail, info, columns, shape, etc. Here got some idea about the dataset.

2. Data Cleaning
Checked the null values followed by duplicated entries, after detection filled the null values with 'Unknown'and'No Name' also dropped feature having most of the null records. Also detected outliers for some features.

3. Data Visualization
Plotted different bar charts, plots, scatterplots for different features. Got insights from that.
